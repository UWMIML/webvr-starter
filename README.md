# WebVR Starter

This webVR starter was built with a guide from [Google][6] and accompanied by a [boilerplate][1].
Here we try to reproduce the moonphases web project initially done [on codepen][2] with just
[Three.js][3] and some mouse controls.

### Running the project
This project can be run on any server. For development purpose I use [http-server][4] which
can be installed with:

```
npm i -g http-server
```

if you already have npm installed. If you don't, it can be gotten from [here][5].
