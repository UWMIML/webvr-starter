# WebVR Starter

> This turned out to rely on a boilerplate that is unmaintained. Hence, while you may see a 3D object rendered in scene on browser, it never renders on HMDs. Look at [webvr-planets instead][8]

This webVR starter was built with a guide from [Google][6] and accompanied by a [boilerplate][1].
Here we try to reproduce the moonphases web project initially done [on codepen][2] with just
[Three.js][3] and some mouse controls.

[Demo][7]

### Running the project
If you do not have npm installed already, get it from [here][5]. Once installed, just run:

```
npm i
```
to install all dependencies. And run the server with:
```
npm start
```
